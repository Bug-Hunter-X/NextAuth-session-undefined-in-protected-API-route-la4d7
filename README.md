# NextAuth Session Undefined in Protected API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue where the NextAuth session object is unexpectedly undefined within a protected API route, even when authentication appears successful.

## Problem

A Next.js API route protected using `unstable_getServerSession` from the `next-auth` package inconsistently returns an undefined session object. The authentication process seems to work, but the API route fails to access user data from the session. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring correct configuration of the API routes and handling potential errors more robustly.  The solution provided checks if the session exists before attempting to access its properties.  In some cases, there may be asynchronous issues, leading to the session not being fully populated before it is used. This example handles that possibility.
